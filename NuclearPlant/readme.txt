Build nuclear plant, generates power by consuming uranium rod.
Build multiple generators in nuclear plant. (Component)
Uranium ore produced from mine in low probability.
Process uranium ore in uranium processor at factory. Operated by engineers.
Generators provides massive energy with or without operated by engineers.
Generators decrease module condition.
Engineers operate generator can increase module condition.
Nuclear plant explode at very low condition.
In short distance, all modules destroyed.
In medium distance, modules broken and some components destroyed.
In long distance, colonists get radiation damage.
Only partial of resources dropped from destroyed modules and components.
